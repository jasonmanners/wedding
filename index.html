            <p>
              Amanda was born and raised in Merced, a small town in the central valley.  Her parents, Bob and Sandee, taught her what a loving and cooperative relationship looks like.  Her older sister, Sarah, taught her how to stand up for herself and how to fake sleeping when your parents check in on you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In highschool, Amanda loved swimming, waterpolo, and boys.  She went to college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, majoring in Architectural Engineering.  Now, Amanda works as a structural drafter by day and cat herder by night.

            <p>
              Jason was born and raised in Moorpark, a small town in the suburbs of Los Angeles, closer to Ventura. His parents, Chris and Lisa, taught him how to work hard, be creative, and most importantly how to treat others. He taught his younger brother, Taylor, how to be messy, play video games until the wee hours of the morning, and how to be irresistible to the ladies.  He taught his younger sister, Kaitlyn, how to grow hair; really, she has really long hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              In highschool, Jason loved to drum, experiment with physics - the boom boom kind, and roam around town with slurpees. He went to college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, majoring in Computer Science and meeting the love of his life. Now, Jason works as a entrepenuer by day and maker of things by night.

                  At a birthday party for a friend of a friend, I was playing beer pong when Jason arrived.  I spotted him immediately and pulled him out of the crowd for take a shot for me, which he missed.  Later in the party, we met up again while helping clean up.  The conversation never stopped flowing since that night.

          <h1>The Proposal</h1>
          <div class='col-md-6'>
            <p>
              It happened on the first night that we were on our Colorado vacation last year...
              When we got into town, we decided to visit the Denver Botanic Gardens first.  When we got there we found that we had picked the perfect day and it was free!  The day was beautiful, the flowers were lovely, but Jason did not propose there.
              Later, we checked into our hotel where we had booked a standard Queen.  When we arrived we were informed that our standard was upgraded to a suite with a kitchen and sitting room!  What luck!  Jason planned none of this!
            </p>
            <p>
              After wallowing in our room for a bit, we went out to dinner with Jason's cousin, Schyler, at a diner just down the street.  The food was good, the company was even better, but Jason didn't propose there either.
              Once we dropped Schyler off, we decided to keep the night going and visit a landmark about 30 minutes outside of Denver called Red Rock Ampitheater.  This is a beautiful venue where many famous bands perform with a backdrop of impressively huge rocks and a stricking view of the city.  There were no bands playing that night, but we had heard that it was awesome for photographs when no one was around.  So we brought Amanda's camera and tripod and Jason brought his backpack that he was weirdly clutching and checking on all day.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we got to the ampitheater an employee politely informed us that it would be closing in just a few minutes!  Jason picked up his pace markedly and dragged Amanda to the first spot that you could see the city.  But Amanda, not knowing that Jason had something very special planned, decided this spot wasn't good enough and made them move on.  On the way to the next and final spot, Jason was so nervous and rushed, that he missed a stair and scraped up his ankle pretty good.  But he played it off gallantly and didn't let on how much it hurt until much later.  When Amanda finally agreed to a spot, they set up her tripod and she spend some time adjusting her camera.  She was trying to focus it and said, "I think you should take a look at this, I can never seem to get it right", to which Jason replied "Just take the picture."  Little did she know, he was already down on one knee behind her!  So Amanda snapped the long exposure and Jason said her name to get her to turn around.  She found him on his knee, and after a few moments of silence asked, "What are you doing?"  That's when Jason popped the question and gave her the ring.  Amanda was so surprised, and promptly said yes!
