            <h2><small>Her</small></h2>
            <p>
              Amanda was born and raised in Merced, a small town in the central valley.  Her parents, Bob and Sandee, taught her what a loving and cooperative relationship looks like.  Her older sister, Sarah, taught her how to stand up for herself and how to fake sleeping when your parents check in on you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In highschool, Amanda loved swimming, waterpolo, and boys.  She went to college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, majoring in Architectural Engineering.  Now, Amanda works as a structural drafter by day and cat herder by night.

            <p>
              Jason was born and raised in Moorpark, a small town in the suburbs of Los Angeles, closer to Ventura. His parents, Chris and Lisa, taught him how to work hard, be creative, and most importantly how to treat others. He taught his younger brother, Taylor, how to be messy, play video games until the wee hours of the morning, and how to be irresistible to the ladies.  He taught his younger sister, Kaitlyn, how to grow hair; really, she has really long hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              In highschool, Jason loved to drum, experiment with physics - the boom boom kind, and roam around town with slurpees. He went to college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, majoring in Computer Science and meeting the love of his life. Now, Jason works as a entrepenuer by day and maker of things by night.

            <p>I know what you are thinking, but a party is not like a bar. Plus it was a birthday party for a friend.</p>
            <p class='her'>I knew Lea through my roommate, Scott.</p>
            <p class='him'>I had met Lea a few times but my roommate, RJ, hung out with them a lot.</p>
            <p>Amanda was playing beer pong in the backyard with some friends as Jason said his hellos and made his way to the backyard.</p>
            <p class='her'>I saw him in the crowd and knew I had to meet him. His smile made me melt.</p>
            <p class='him'>I noticed her playing beer pong and was wondering if she would notice me.</p>
            <p>She asked him to take a <em class='text-muted tooltip-anchor' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement="bottom" title="In beer pong, a Celebrity shot is where you choose another person to take the shot for you.">celebrity shot</em></p>
            <p class='her'>He airballed, it was was so cute!</p>
            <p class='him'>That was probably the worst shot I had taken ever. I left the table in shame.</p>
            <p>The party went on and it started getting later. Amanda started looking around and found one of Jason's friends.</p>
            <p>She talked with him for a few minutes and finally got the information she wanted, Jason's name!</p>
            <p class='her'>I felt the perfect pickup line forming in my mind.</p>
            <p class='him'>I was still in the backyard looking around for her, wondering where she had gone.</p>
            <p>Amanda moved to the backyard and saw him. She started cleaning up one of the tables to make herself available</p>
            <p class='her'>I was so nervous, I needed to do something with my hands!</p>
            <p class='him'>I finally found her cleaning up one of the tables. And she was alone, what luck! I was finally going to get to talk to her after that embarassing shot.</p>
            <p>They talked for a few minutes and she dropped the best pickup lines in the history of pickup lines.</p>
            <blockquote>I'm Psychic. Your name is Jason!</blockquote>
            <p class='her'>I could tell he was blown away and trying to figure out how I knew.</p>
            <p class='him'>Alright that was crazy, I don't know how she knew that. Did I know her from somewhere?</p>
            <p>They continued to talk and the night flew by. Golden retrievers and Nintendo 64 were mentioned a lot but finally the night started coming to a close.</p>
            <p class='her'>In the end, I had to ask him for his phone number!</p>
            <p class='him'>I was getting to it! She just didn't give me enough time.</p>
            <p>And so ends the beginning of our beautiful love story.</p>
            <p class='her'>Done!</p>
            <p class='him'>Done!</p>

          <h1>The Proposal</h1>
          <div class='col-md-6'>
            <p>
              It happened on the first night that we were on our Colorado vacation last year...
              When we got into town, we decided to visit the Denver Botanic Gardens first.  When we got there we found that we had picked the perfect day and it was free!  The day was beautiful, the flowers were lovely, but Jason did not propose there.
              Later, we checked into our hotel where we had booked a standard Queen.  When we arrived we were informed that our standard was upgraded to a suite with a kitchen and sitting room!  What luck!  Jason planned none of this!
            </p>
            <p>
              After wallowing in our room for a bit, we went out to dinner with Jason's cousin, Schyler, at a diner just down the street.  The food was good, the company was even better, but Jason didn't propose there either.
              Once we dropped Schyler off, we decided to keep the night going and visit a landmark about 30 minutes outside of Denver called Red Rock Ampitheater.  This is a beautiful venue where many famous bands perform with a backdrop of impressively huge rocks and a stricking view of the city.  There were no bands playing that night, but we had heard that it was awesome for photographs when no one was around.  So we brought Amanda's camera and tripod and Jason brought his backpack that he was weirdly clutching and checking on all day.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we got to the ampitheater an employee politely informed us that it would be closing in just a few minutes!  Jason picked up his pace markedly and dragged Amanda to the first spot that you could see the city.  But Amanda, not knowing that Jason had something very special planned, decided this spot wasn't good enough and made them move on.  On the way to the next and final spot, Jason was so nervous and rushed, that he missed a stair and scraped up his ankle pretty good.  But he played it off gallantly and didn't let on how much it hurt until much later.  When Amanda finally agreed to a spot, they set up her tripod and she spend some time adjusting her camera.  She was trying to focus it and said, "I think you should take a look at this, I can never seem to get it right", to which Jason replied "Just take the picture."  Little did she know, he was already down on one knee behind her!  So Amanda snapped the long exposure and Jason said her name to get her to turn around.  She found him on his knee, and after a few moments of silence asked, "What are you doing?"  That's when Jason popped the question and gave her the ring.  Amanda was so surprised, and promptly said yes!

                  The ceremony will take place on a hill next to the main barn where we will be having the reception.  The ceremony will be all outdoors (weather permitting), so please dress accordingly.  The incline to the ceremony site is moderate, so wear shoes that you can walk uphill in for about 100 feet or so.  There will be a cart to take you up to the site for our guests with disabilities.  The reception space will be 
                  completely sheltered from wind and rain, so no need to wear anything special there.
